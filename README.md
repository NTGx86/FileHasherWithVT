# FileHasherWithVT
Python script that hashes files for common hash types and provides optional VirusTotal Submission

As of May 2023 the script creates a MD4 hash of files in a target folder and submits the file hashes
to VirusTotal. 

Future Plans: 

1) Adjust the script to have it create file hashes for all common hash types and print to screen. 
2) Allow for optional VirusTotal Submission (as there are rate limits for free accounts & privacy concerns) 
3) Adjust script to allow command-line processing for scrictly file hashing or user guided. 

Additional Notes: This script just like many other on my GitHub page are tools that I delevoped as projects
in response to my cybersecurity engineering coursework at the University of Arizona. With that in mind, many 
of the functionality is not novel or groundbreaking, but simply a method for me to apply my skills and have 
fun with python.
